# Hand-Tracking-Distance-
Typical hand Tracking python code that uses mediapipe and openCV. The purpose of this code is to identify the distance of your hands to the camera, this code also shows which hand is your left and which is your right.

How to install:
- for this I use VScode and its as simple as typing these into the terminal, make sure pip is updated if you are using pip.

OpenCV
- pip install opencv-python

Mediapipe
- pip install mediapipe
- or conda install -c conda-forge mediapipe

FYI:
- I might have made a mistake identifying left and right hands, it works but it might be confusing to read.
